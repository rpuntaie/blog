Implication(FCA)

In [[Formal_concept_analysis|formal concept analysis]] (FCA) and [[Closure_operator|closure system]] 
attributes are analyzed via their (simultaneous) occurrences (= objects). The implicational analysis 
deals with [[Algorithm|altorithms]] to find a minimal set of rules, 
by which attributes can be inferred from others (implications).

== Definition <ref name="implications">Implications by Ganter and Stumme [http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~ganter/cl03/stumme/chapter5.pdf]</ref> ==

A pair of sets <math>(U,V)</math> is an ''implication''.
<math>U \subseteq A</math> and <math>V\subseteq A</math>. U is the ''premise''
and V is the ''conclusion''.  <math>A</math> stands for attributes.

A set W ''respects'' <math>U\rightarrow V</math>, 
if <math>U\nsubseteq W \:\text{or}\: V\subseteq W</math>. 

== Implications in a Concept Lattice <ref name="implications"/> ==

<math>U\rightarrow V</math> ''holds in'' a concept lattice, if every intent respects it.
This is true if 

# iff <math>U' \subseteq V'</math>.

# iff <math>V\subseteq U''</math>. 

An implication <math>U\rightarrow V</math> follows semantically from a set L of implications,
if each subset of <math>A</math> respecting L also respects <math>U\rightarrow V</math>. 
L is ''closed'', if it contains all implications that follow from L. 

A set L of implications that hold in a context is called ''sound''. It is called
''complete'' if every implications that holds in the context follows from L.
L is ''non-redundant'' if implications that follow from L are not in L.

If L is a set of implications, then 
<math>\{X\subseteq A | X\; \text{respects}\; L\}</math> is a [[Closure_operator|closure system]].

== Implication Basis <ref name="implications"/> ==

Let <math>X \;\mapsto \;X''</math> be a [[Closure_operator|closure operator]]
then ''P'' is ''pseudo-closed'' if 

# <math>P \;\neq \;P''</math>
# <math>Q\subset P \implies Q''\subseteq P</math>

The set <math>\{P \mapsto P'' | P \;\text{pseudo-closed} \}</math> is ''sound'', ''complete'' and ''non-redundant''.
It is called ''Duquenne-Guiges-Basis'' (D-G-basis) or ''Stem basis''.

There cannot be a implication basis with less implications than the Duquenne-Guiges-Basis, but 
one can choose implications that are simpler regarding <math>\sum |U| |V|</math>.
Such implications are <math>U\rightarrow V</math> with <math>V\neq \emptyset</math> and <math>U\cap V = \emptyset</math>
