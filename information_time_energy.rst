Information is all.
Variable, time, energy.

Summary
=======

.. _`evolution`: https://rolandpuntaier.blogspot.com/2019/01/evolution.html

In the `evolution` blog I started from "there is no one time",
rather every independent change is its own time.
Here I come to the conclusion that "time is all" or "information is all".
This is no contradiction. It is a realization that information is time.

Interpretation of energy is clearer here, too.
To say `E=I/t` is like saying that energy is time divided by time.

:Variable/value:
Values of a physical variable are defined by time and define time for the variable.
Every variable has its own information and its own time.

:Information = action = time:
The information of a variable is the number of values.

:Cycle:
The values of a variable cycle until the variables ceases to exist.
A variable has a curvature when expressed with its observables.
Values exist only while occurring.

:Momentum: `p=∂I/∂x`.
Component of a value of a variable.
Component of a time step.

:Energy: `E=dI/dt=İ`.
The energy of a variable is its time steps compared to the time steps of another variable.
When looking at a part of a system,
energy can also mean the inflow or outflow of information.

:Force: `F=dE/dx=-ṗ`
Component of energy.
Component of momentum change.

:Levels:
A level consists of parallel variables (encapsulations of interactions or particles).
The variables of the lower level become values in this level.
Every level has its independent variables with own times.

:Resolution:
Every level has its own information resolution: `dI=Edt=dx(∂I/∂x)-dp(∂I/∂p)`.
On the lowest physical level the information unit is `h`.

Information-Time-Energy
=======================

.. {information}

Information
-----------

When we think of information we think of a language that conveys information.
But first there need to be the alternatives the words of a language select from.

Our language consists of words.
The word selects one of the concepts in the mind of the person we talk to.
The concepts in the mind refer to real things.
Tree, stone, house, ...

Dynamic systems evolve by alternatives and selection (mutation and selection).
Think of the biological evolution, mind, science, economy, ...
There is a creative phase and a selective phase.
In human contexts they can also be called "search and find"
or "trial and error" or "learn and control".
But we can also point the two words to the same thing.
The selection itself brings the thing into existence in the first place.
Physical processes can be seen as such.

Many physical systems have no memory, but they have information.
And, although we have a memory of concepts,
they only become conscious those times we think of them.

You probably have had some maths in school.
So the concept of a **set** should be familiar.
The `∈` of a set selects one element from a set.
But the set has operations like **union** and **intersection**.
They are more complicated and can be decomposed into individual selections.

There is an idea that is more fundamental than the set.
It is the ubiquitous **variable**.
How could it be otherwise.
Something so fundamental must be ubiquitous.

The foundation of mathematics is not the set, but the **variable**.
The variable is the foundation of all dynamic systems.

The **variable** consists of **values**.
Other words for values are alternatives or states.

A variable consists of all the values

- that occur (exhaustiveness) and
- that exclude each other (exclusiveness)

I define information this way:

**Information** is the number of values of a variable.

.. {time}

Time
----

The values of the variable occur and excludes each other.
In casual English one would say "a value at a time".
That is exactly what physical time is.

A **time** step is the selection or change of value of a variable.
In between selections that variable has no time.

Every variable has its own time.

A time step is a value of the variable.

.. math::

   t = I

Components of values ( = coordinates = observables),
that change at the same time,
are one value, physically.

.. {energy variable}

Energy of a Variable
--------------------

The values of a variable can occur slowly or fast.
But that can only be seen, if we have another variable to compare to.
Our mind has an internal clock, that gives a comparison.

When we run a film in slow or fast motion,
we get an idea that the time during film shooting
can be seen as either slow or fast,
depending on our reference time.

In other words: energy is *time* compared to *time*.
The first time we call information.

.. math::

   E = \frac{ΔI}{Δt} = \frac{Δt_1}{Δt_2}

Energy is the rate of selection,
or information rate.

The comparison `E=ΔI/Δt` is with an unrelated other variable `t`.
This happens only in the mind. It is not physical.
The other `t` is an arbitrarily chosen unit of information
and `E` is the number value of information (`I=Et`).
One can also do it in reversed,
then `1/t` (Hertz, Hz) is the unit of `E` and `I` is the number value.
But `I` demands values, changes, time.
`I` itself has a proper time.

In nature many variables are isolated.
With just one variable the only time its own,
and `E=dI/dI=1`.
Information means energy and vice versa.

Do we need to choose another variable to have time? No.
Our variable changes its values
and that is the proper time of the variable.
Without time the values do not change.
Then there is no time and so the variable does not get into existence.

The variable thus defines:

- information
- *and* time

Information implies time and time implies information.
Time and information are equivalent, physically.
With just one variable information and time are synonyms
and energy is just 1 or has no meaning.

The comparison is often just a thing of our mind.
The physical motivation for energy comes when the selections of
one variable matters with respect to the selections of another variable.
The other variable is called time
to distinguish it from the first variable,
but that time is still information.

A physical change is looked at by arbitrary coordinates of the mind.
More `dx_1, dx_2, ...` can constitute one physical change `dI`.

The value `dI` of a physical variable is an interaction between observables.
An interaction is one time step with possibly more participants/observables.

In a higher physical levels, the `x_i` take part in an interaction:

.. math::

   E = \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{∂I}{∂x_i}\frac{dx_i}{dt} = p_i ẋ_i

The energy `E=İ` compares `I` to some external `t`.
Classical mechanics introduced the
energy components `∂H/∂{x,p}={-ṗ,ẋ}`,
the forces.
Quantum mechanics realized
that the `dpdx` step is the time step: `∂ψ/∂t = ∂²ψ/(∂p∂x)`,
by which is meant that,
on the left side we have `∂t` where on the right side we have `∂p∂x`.
The `ψ` is our information `I`.


.. {cycle}

Cycle
-----

As long as a variable exists
a variable cycles through its values
with constant rate `E`.

How much external time a cycle takes, depends on

- the number of values (information)
- and the rate of selection (energy)

.. math::

   t = \frac{I}{E}

Selections order the values.
If the last value is reached,
the selection continues with the first.
This brings the first value near the last.
How can you do that with one variable alone?

In two dimension you can create a circle,
in which the last value is close to the first one.
And indeed, nature has examples of two variables,
think of the electric and magnetic fields in electricity
or the elevation and velocity of a pendulum.

What is meant by a variable here is defined by a change,
i.e. by a time step.
Within one `Δt` changes of at least two observables combine to one.

The value combinations of two or more observables
form a physical and inherently cyclic variable.

.. {level}

Levels
------

The physical world is layered.
A level is defined by its variables and interactions.

Every level has

- an information quantum, which implicitly defines
- a typical information rate (energy)

On the physically lowest level,
it is the Planck constant `h`::

   EΔt = ΔI = h

`Δt` and `ΔI` are both information of some distinct variables.
On the lowest level we have `Δt=ΔI=h` and thus `E=1`.

`ΔI` also defines an acceptable deviation for a level.
This is a generalization of energy levels of an electron in atom orbitals,
and would be called information levels here.

One level builds on top of the other.
All the cumulative changes through the levels
are limited by the rate on the lowest level.
Higher level changes are slower,
because they involve lower level changes
over more levels.

If a higher level changes faster,
then the levels below need to get slower,
because `h` itself does not change.

In higher levels the quantum of information can be quite large.
One can still choose a natural unit of information for a level,
like `h` for the lowest level.


.. {speed vs rate of information}

Speed vs rate of information
----------------------------

`E=I/t` compares time with time.
There is no physical space involved.
So information cannot be attributed a speed in physical space.

The physical space is contained in the definition of a specific `I`
(and so in a specific `t`)
by their simultaneous changes with the components of `I` along them (momenta).

If I say a word,
the travel time of the word to my interlocutor and its interpretation to a concept,
is one value in our interaction, in our communication.
The changes (observables) of the communication partners
to form and interpret the message is shared between the partners.
This principle applies also to lower level physical interactions.

On the lowest level the signal speed is that of the speed of light `c`.
On higher levels it is a lot slower (but can also be called the `c` of the level).

`c` compares to an external time `t` already.
`ct` removes that external time.
This gives the proper time unit `dI` a space extend.

A value does not move from place to place,
but it has a space size unit, a space quantum.
The components of a value are quantized.
In the lowest level this is `ΔpΔx ≥ h`.

The next value can occupy a different space close by.
With photons `hν` photons that space is `λ=c/ν` away (`hν=hc/λ`),
`t=1/ν` later (`Et=hνt=h`).

Higher energies cycle locally which binds some `h` in a mass `m`.
`m` encapsulates all the lower levels.
`E²=p²c²+m²c⁴`.
If `p=0`, all the energy is within `m`.

`mv=h/λ` attribution of smaller `λ` to higher momenta
are due to the many parallel lower level particles averaging
and producing a space precision that is not there in the single particle.


.. {particle}

Particle
--------

A physical variable that acts as a value in a level is sometimes called a particle.
A particle is a synonym to a variable used to distinguish in specific contexts.
One can use particle to distinguish from mind variables.

Information quanta have or are a time extend
and also have a physical space extend.
So the particle is a space-time quantum.

Instead of variable levels we have particle levels.
The interactions in higher levels take a longer time
and involve more physical space.
But the information needs to cycle during such long times,
to conserve its information.
There are cycling encapsulations all the way down to the lowest level,
which cycles with `h`.
Interaction in higher levels are via particles in lower levels.

A particle has its internal interactions, its internal time.
Mass is another name for energy (here information),
meaning the inner cycling of a particle.

In an interaction between people, the interaction is the particle.
Looking at a person itself is looking at a lower level particle,
that has inner interactions (i.e. inner particles).

.. {Static vs dynamic information}

Static vs dynamic Information
-----------------------------

Our mind/brain has its own time.
We often neglects the physical time implied by a physical variable
and use our brain time on the values instead,
but that brain time is a different time than the time of the observed variable itself.
Mind variables are also physical, because the mind is physical,
but when mapping from reality, the time is replaced by that of the brain.

In mathematics the same logic can be followed by different brains,
i.e. different times, different time durations.
Mathematics considers variables without time,
but to actually exist all these variables need to be thought,
i.e. time needs to be added.
Mathematics often abstracts away how the values came into existence,
and that they came into existence at different times.

In a variable without time we only have the count of values (static variable).
One can make the count of values
using combinations of values of other static variables.
We use the variable of `{0,..,9}` (digit) to count
or the `{a,..,z}` (alphabet) to address concepts.
One could also use digits for addressing.
Computers use the bit `{0,1}`,
because that is the smallest variable one can still choose from.
Since the bit is smaller than the digit,
the word length is larger (`100000000` vs `256`).

The number of bits/digits/alphabets needed to produce the combinations `I`:

.. math::

   S = log I

S counts the unit variables to produce an described variable's count.
Seen this way, a variable count in its own unit is 1.
This look is that on a level, where the variable is a value.

Between levels, when including a lower level,
e.g. because the lower level matters,
we transition from addition to multiplication.
We transition from multiplication to addition,
i.e. we use the logarithm, in the other direction.

In thermodynamic systems we have two levels.
The upper level does not distinguish
between all the `2^S` combinations of values from the lower level.

Entropy is the upper level part in a two level system.
Entropy is the count of independent variables, the molecules,
whose values (timing) are compared independently (lower level energy).

The lower level part is the temperature `T`,
which is the average energy of a molecule.

The interactions between upper level compartments
would be to exchange molecules, i.e. entropy `S`.

Lower level temperature interaction (heat equation)
is quite similar to the quantum mechanical Schrödinger equation.
Both compare the time of one level with a two level process.
Change and thus time happening in the upper level is
due to different information rate in the lower level.

For comparison, the wave equation compares
the two times of two levels (not one time)
with the space components of two levels.

Temperature `T` is the average energy per molecule.
Similarly pressure `p` is the average energy per volume (energy packet = particle)
and `V` is a higher level variable that counts the lower level packets.

.. math::

   E = ST = pV

A higher level equilibrium means no time in the higher level,
but it corresponds to a maximum number of lower level interactions.
All the exchange of information (`E`)
is in the lower level and at equal rate in both direction.

If more exchange were in the higher level,
the lower level would have less.

The molecules have still further lower levels
and they exchange information, too: via electromagnetic radiation.
If the temperature increases the molecule velocity increases.
Velocity alone has no energy, because it is a value,
but in collisions a higher velocity means more steps to reach 0 or `v`.
Molecule velocity change is in the thermal level.
Because there is more change in the thermal level,
the atom's orbital timing needs to decrease or increase,
which produces discrete photon emissions or absorptions in the orbitals,
but experience a random Doppler shift due to relative thermal motion,
which leads to the `Planck law`_.

.. {energy as information flow}

Energy as Information Flow
--------------------------

`E=dI/dt` can compare the whole variable to some unrelated variable `t`,
in which case `I` stays constant and `E` is a unit conversion (`I=Et`). 

But we can also look at a part of a system,
and see `E=dI/dt` as inflow or outflow of information,
thereby neglecting the other partner of the interaction.

Adding or removing information to a system is a higher level time.

If information is added to a variable,
the variable becomes a different variable.

Information can exist only as cycling variables.
So information is transported as information/energy packets (particles),
for example as molecules of a certain chemical energy content.
The molecular interactions use atoms as packets.
The atomic nucleus uses nucleons as packets.
Every layer has its own packets.

Every layer has its own frequency of packet exchange.
This is the time of the level.
When compared to some other time we have the energy
relevant for the level.
Energy is expressed in a unit relevant for the level.
Relevant, usable energy is level-specific.

If levels interact more levels need to be considered.
If one level's frequency is called energy,
then the next higher level's frequency is called power.
For example, in electricity energy `E=UQ` is an energy of one level
and power `P=UI=fE` is the energy of the next level.
`E` is the quantum `h` in this level (this level's time step),
and `f` is the energy of the level, the comparison to some external `t`.

The energy is important as a measure
to express the relative rate of information exchange between systems.
How fast an exchange is in comparison to the other, decides

- where the accumulation of information happens
- who survives how long

The joint system dies, if there is nothing to accumulate any more.

There can also be a back and forth of accumulation,
for the joint system to survive longer.
One system is the potential energy for the other system and vice versa.
The states of the joint system
can be considered as the values of the system as a variable.

The exchange of information packets takes time,
but that time is shared between the two systems.
The time step thus makes both changes as one.

A variable is an information unit `I`.
`I` is the time or the variable.
Comparing it to an external variable `t`
cannot change the internal physics.
Energy `E=I/t` is a property of the variable, not of the value,
and especially not of the components of a value.
To express energy as functions of values gives a wrong picture.
It is an indirect mapping: value -> variable -> energy.
The variable has one energy.
All values just map to this energy,
which is the same for all values.

Saying `E=mv²/2+mgh` describes the `v,h` observables
sharing the same energy `E`,
i.e. the energy of a variable and not of a value.
Expressing `E=mv²/2` or `E=mgh` separately and
as a function of values has no meaning.

The word energy is often used in the sense of information, as understood here.
I also use energy in the sense of information as understood here.
Here information implies time and thus also energy.
That physically they are the same,
is the major statement here.

Mathematics uses information in a static sense,
although physically it exists only when processed by a brain.
Also physics uses entropy `S` or mass `m` for static information,
but according to the understanding here,
this just neglects lower level dynamics (`m`)
or this level's dynamics `S`.
So, although not physical,
to distinguish between energy and information makes sense
as a tool to give a shorter description of a specific context.

Interaction between Levels
--------------------------

"Information is time" means that
information does not exist without processing.
Higher level particles have more inner processing
and are thus higher in low level energy.
They are energy packets.

The high level interactions can be slow (low in level energy)
compared to lower levels.

A level has a more or less constant information rate `T`.
But the `S` parallel particles can encapsulate more levels
(animal, cell, molecule, atom, ...).
Each level has information processing and thus stores energy.

Information flows between levels, too.
For example, when two molecules react,
they release energy to the thermodynamic level (`ΔH`).

Lower level variables get destroyed
to create higher level variables, i.e. higher level processing.

The Maxwell Demon (controller) works between levels.
Many level systems like living beings (microorganism, plants, animals, ...),
but also companies or social structures in general
use this principle of control.

The controller maps the higher level logic to a lower level,
which processes faster.
The lower level simulates the logic of the higher level.
As the lower level is faster,
it can pick high energy packets.
Then the controller uses the inner energy of the high energy packet,
to keeps its own interactions (keep `T`) running or to reproduce (increase `S`)
(change `T` or `S` in a generalized `E=TS`).

Higher energy packets demands for energy storage.
Storage divided by consumption determines the rate of high level interaction.
Higher level exchange rates are slower.

When the higher level changes its logic
the controller must adapt (learn to control).
Such changes are slower than the selection of the energy packets.

- The DNA in living organisms is a mapping of the ecosystem.
  It changes with the ecosystem or gets extinct.

- Emotions change with the availability of resources over generations.

- Rational thinking adapts within the lifetime.

That he total information flow distributes to complex levels on earth
is due to slow cooling (annealing) over a long time.
If `E` goes down, `ST` can keep a constant `T` by reducing `S` at a level,
e.g. by making larger molecules.
Systems that encapsulate, live longer in the presence of cooling.
To live longer means a smaller rate, i.e. less `E`.
The same happens in the learning brain, to the economy, and other dynamic systems.


.. {Newton}

Newton
------

Newton (rephrased):
An object rests or moves in a straight line with constant speed,
unless there is an interaction (force) with another object
and that force changes both objects (*action=reactio*).

A straight line would imply an infinity.
There is no infinity in the physical world.
Real systems always cycle until they cease to exist as system.
Every curved line seems straight with enough zooming.
That is why in physics one always uses manifolds
instead of the mathematical `ℝ^n`.
Newton's straight line needs to be replaced by a geodesic,
whose curvature is that of the cycling variable.

Information implies time.
Time is force.
There is always a force.

Normally one looks at objects that are obviously interacting.
They have a time.
An isolated object does not exist.
If you found one, it already interacted with you.
If that interaction does not explain its behavior,
you need to search for other objects it interacts with.

With the *actio=reactio*,
it is implied that the two object's changes are observables of one change,
and thus constitute one time step.
The force is shared between the interacting objects.

Velocity cannot be seen or measured physically from inside its own inertial frame,
so it has no information.
From outside that is the same.
Velocity is a component of a value and not a physical variable.
A value does have no information.
What exists physically is a change of velocity,
and that change is accompanied by another change.
The force is shared.

.. math::

   0 & = \frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{∂τ}{∂x}\;\frac{dx}{dt}\right) = \\
   & = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{∂τ}{∂x}\right)\;\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{∂τ}{∂x}\;\frac{d²x}{dt²} = \\
   & = \frac{dE}{dx}\;\frac{dx}{dt} + m\frac{dx}{dt}\;\frac{d²x}{dt²}

And then divide by `dx/dt` to get Newton's force law:

.. math::

   \left[ F \coloneqq -\frac{dE}{dx} \right] = ma

The part in brackets is a definition of force.

The modern way to get to this formula is the Lagrange way, though,
with a minimization step that finds what actually constitues one time step,
and the formula is more general: it is the Euler-Lagrange equation.

To get to Newton's formula an unexplained step was used:

.. math::

   \frac{∂τ}{∂x} = m \frac{dx}{dt}

This is thus a consequence of Newton's force law.
It relates the two time, `τ` and `t`, of two levels.

Giving different variables different times
solves the *vis-viva* debate that was going on between Newton (`mv`),
Leibnitz (`mv²/2`) and others.

`∂τ/∂x` is a component of a change, i.e. of a time or information step.
Time is an interaction with more partners.
This leads to the concept of energy:

.. math::

   E = \frac{dτ}{dt} = \frac{∂τ}{∂x}\;\frac{dx}{dt}

Reordering gives `dx/dt = E ∂x/∂τ`,
and by comparing to `m\;dx/dt`
one can see that the mass `m` is actually an energy, too.

Comparisons to `t` are not physical, but a necessity of the mind.
By comparing more observable changes to one external time `t`,
one can relate changes and create a topology and a metric on it
for a specific system.

The double comparison with the same external `t` leads to `mv²`:

.. math::

   E = \frac{∂τ}{∂x}\;\frac{dx}{dt} = m\frac{dx}{dt}\;\frac{dx}{dt} = mv²

`E` is the full energy. `m` summarizes lower level energies.
With `c` as maximum `v`,
there are no lower level changes possible any more,
and thus mass is exactly the movement itself: `m=E/c²`.


.. {mind vs reality}

Mind vs Reality
---------------

Our mind is a physical system itself,
and has its own time.
Actually there are independent parallel processes in the mind,
which have separate times.
But they are compared to one time,
which creates the feeling of conciousness.

A variable is defined by its values.
The number of values is the information `I` of the variable.
`dI` is a system change and thus the system time.

"Space" means generally the value-components of an interaction (a value),
not necessarily physical space.

The space values exist only when actually happening.
This also applies to physical space.
Our memory of physical space,
for example when moving the hand through the air,
is not the physical space itself.

A change can have more components within the same time.
The components are mind variables,
also called observables or coordinates.
The mind can change them independently,
i.e. give them their own time,
but the physical system does not.

Comparing independent variables,
results in these quantities:

- **energy** `E=dI/dt` compares times of two variables
- **momentum** `p=∂I/∂x` compares time with a component

Independent variables have separate times.
Independent variables can exist in parallel,
at the same higher level time,
or sequentially.

**Entropy** `S=log I` counts parallel variables of same kind,
whose actions sum up physically.
`S=log I` is also the word length,
of a language to address values of a larger variable.

A variable exists as long as its values **cycle**.
Since the values are cyclic,
there need to be at least two components
to connect the last value with the first.
`p,x` are such two conjugate components.
They are called phase space to express in which phase the cycle of the variable is in.
A `dI` time step corresponds to a `dpdx` in the phase space.

`x` is a mind variable,
where we can spend a lot of time looping to arbitrary precision,
but the physical `dI` is limited by the Planck constant `h`.
`h` is the smallest, lowest level, unit of counting,
i.e. the smallest time unit of nature.
Nature is layered, though, and every level above has a larger time unit.

`I=ψ`. In the Schrödinger and the Dirac equation,
it is compared to another external time `t`: `\frac{∂ψ}{dt}`
Time is information.

The physical world is imprecise and finite.
How to describe finite systems with our infinite variables of the mind?
This is done by convolution `∫ψ*ψdxdt = <ψ|ψ>`.

Any `x,t` our mind has finite precision.
To any `x,t` of our mind the physical world, still and also, has imprecision.
`ψ` summarizes both imprecisions.
`ψ` counts how many alternative by chance states there are for a given `x,t`.

That a complex probability amplitude is used for `ψ`,
allows to map whatever physical variables to two cycling meta-variables.
Multiplying (convolving) with the conjugate `<ψ|ψ>`
finally projects the cycle onto the direction of the observer.

The evolution in time `t` of `I=ψ` is the energy `H`
(Schrödinger equation):

.. math::

  iħ\frac{∂ψ}{dt} = Hψ

`i` because of the differentiation and `ħ=\frac{h}{2π}` due to `hν = ħω`.

Since `I=ψ` implies time, the left side is time by time.
The right side is what components constitutes one time step.

In the Dirac equation the `ψ` has four components corresponding to the same time.

The cycling produces the spin.
For a photon it is the cycling between `E` and `B`
and it can be mapped to `x_i,t` (`=x_μ`)
via the Maxwell equations.
The `E,B`-cycling correspondence to one `x_μ`-rotation
makes the photon a spin 1 particle.

If more variables are involved
one cycling corresponds to more or less physical space rotations.
For the Dirac `ψ`, one space rotation is only half of the cycle:
Fermions have spin `1/2`.

Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
--------------------------

A system is described by variables of our choosing (mind variable), like `x_1,x_2,...`,
which are sometimes collectively named `x`.
The mind can see all values separately,
like `x_1` can be space points at position `1m, 2m, ...`.
But from the system's perspective one change combines changes of different mind variables.
A value combination of the values of `x_1, x_2, ...` forms one value, i.e. one change,
and thus defines one system time step.
The time steps need to cycle. So there is no linear motion involved.

As an example, a planet in a circular orbit changes `x_1,x_2` and `ẋ_1,ẋ_2`.
But then, that motion repeats every year.
The whole motion of the planet is one variable whose values cycle.
The planet orbit could change by collision with an asteroid,
but until then the variable's values cycles as is.

The Lagrangian approach is to fixate the time steps and count the changes in the system
per time step, which is `L`.
Then sum over the cycle time: `J=∫Ldt`.

What are the number of values in the variable?
Number of values would be relative to a unit in the macroscopic world,
but in the quantum scale it can be seen as such:
number of value, each counting as 1 (`h=1`).

We cannot just look at the planet.
The planet's orbit is due to an interaction between planet and sun.
They exchange something that keeps them together (force particles).
This is like handing over money: one spends the other earns.
Both change their financial status, but the time step is just one.
`L` would count the money twice, considering the spender and the earner separately.

Minimizing `J=∫Ldt` one gets the Euler-Lagrange equation.

.. math::

   J = ∫ L(x(t),ẋ(t)) dt \\
  \frac{δJ}{δx} = ∫ \frac{∂L}{∂x}\frac{dx}{dt}dt + ∫\frac{∂L}{∂ẋ}\frac{dẋ}{dt}dt =\\
  \text{partial integration of second part} \\
  ... = ∫ \frac{∂L}{∂x}\frac{dx}{dt} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{∂L}{∂ẋ}\frac{dx}{dt}

`δJ/δx = 0` (`J` becomes information `I`):

.. math::

   \frac{∂L}{∂x} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{∂L}{∂ẋ} = 0

By replacing `∂_ẋ L = p` and `F=∂_x L`, this is Newtons `F=ṗ=ma`.

Since we minimized with respect to time,
this equation tells us what belongs to the same time step.

`L` did double count.
After minimization we use `H` instead.
`L(x,ẋ)` is transformed to `H(p,x)` via a Legendre transformation.

.. math::

   \frac{dL}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}\left(ẋ\frac{∂L}{∂ẋ}\right) + \frac{∂L}{∂t} \\
   0 = \frac{d}{dt}\left(ẋ\frac{∂L}{∂ẋ}-L\right) + \frac{∂L}{∂t} => \\
   E = H = pẋ - L(x,ẋ(p,x))

`E=H=dI/dt` for a closed system is constant.
For a non-closed system there is the `Hamilton-Jacobi`_ `∂J/∂t=-H`,
which is basically the same, but on a different (upper) level time.
`d` considers more levels in between and `∂` just on level, but
regarding time `∂` is inappropriate,
because `t` is a helper that always summarizes simultaneous events constituting the time step.

.. _`Hamilton-Jacobi`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi_equation

Interactions have a constant rate unless the exchanged energy packets become of higher value.
The cycling values of a variable from this level form the energy packet of the next higher level.

`I = ∫dI = ∫Hdt` is the full count of values, i.e. the full information of the system.
`H = dI/dt` compares the system time steps `dI` to some other system's time `t`,
without double counting.

The Euler-Lagrange equation become the Hamilton equations.

.. math::

  \frac{∂H}{∂x} = -\frac{dp}{dt} \\
  \frac{∂H}{∂p} =  \frac{dx}{dt}


`F=∂_x H` is the reason for `∫Fds=E`.

Without the external `dt` in the Hamilton equations, we have:

.. math::

  \frac{∂I}{∂x} = -dp \\
  \frac{∂I}{∂p} = dx

Or:

.. math::

  dI = dpdx

Each `dI` change is represented by a phase space volume element `dpdx`.

The information resolution of the physical world has a lower limit `h`.

.. math::

  dI = dpdx ≥ h

`dpdx` is just an example.
It leads to the Schrödinger equation.
The Dirac equations has more observables
falling into the same system time step.

A specific constant value `H` in this level
makes one time step in this level
(which by itself has no information and cannot be described)
and represents a geodesic in the lower variable,
i.e. the trajectory of value components of the lower variable.
Taking away values from the trajectory,
e.g. reducing the radius in the hydrogen atom's electron orbital,
splits off a separate variable (a photon),
i.e. splits off information and energy,
because the energy of a level is basically constant.

Values do not Commute
---------------------

`dI` is a time step and `H` compares it to some external time step `dt`.
`H(x,q)` is the same for every time step (point in the phase space).
`H` corresponds to the `h` in the lowest level, just that `h` is not compared to a `dt`.

.. math::

   H=\frac{dI}{dt}=\frac{∂I}{∂x}ẋ-\frac{∂I}{∂p}ṗ \\
   h = Hdt = dI = \frac{∂I}{∂x}dx-\frac{∂I}{∂p}dp

So the values of a variable do not commute,
because they are one time, one causal chain, serial.

The values of different variables do commute,
because they are independent, parallel, without correlation.
If one would sum over some external time stretch `T` and divide by `T`,
one would get 0: `1/T∫(dτ/dt)dt→0`.

.. {Topology}

Topology
--------

A variable by itself is sequential, i.e. causal.
The values of higher level variables
are packets composed of
parallel variables of equal or varying size from lower levels.
This can account for all the topologies of our universe.

All the topology is constructed by parallel vs serial in levels.

Since information is time already,
the universe evolves via information alone.

Values of a variable are serial.
Variables themselves can be serial or parallel.
Serialization of variables, makes the variable to a value.
This is like moving up to the next time level.

The timing of a higher level variable
is the result of the topology of variables it builds upon.
On the lowest level the rate is constant and given by `h`.
All serial interactions summed over the layers cannot exceed `h`.

Fast higher level interactions slow down the lower level interactions.
For example,

- in high gravity lower level clocks tick slower or
- if `S` changes fast in a thermodynamic `ST` we cannot reach equilibrium,
  which keeps T based exchange slow
- if humans interact a lot the thinking in the mind becomes slower due to the distraction

With fixed `E`, large variables (with many values) cycle slowly.
A higher level variable can become faster
by making the lower variables of smaller size (`E²=p²c²+m²c⁴`)
or parallel.

Within a level the interactions (`E`) are highest
if lower variables are of same `E` or synchronized.

If interacting parallel variables do not cycle with same `E`,
there is a distribution of information until in equilibrium.
The distribution of information is also called entropy maximization.

More parallel variables increase the information throughput.
Energy in higher levels thus compares the degree of parallelization.
This is a generalization of the thermodynamic `E=ST`.

The inertia (mass) of a larger system is due to the time needed
to change or synchronize lower variables.
It takes information flow and that takes time.

.. {Quantum unit}

Quantum Units
-------------

All the variables that can work as external `t` are  information.
The lowest quantum `h` is therefore also a time quantum.

.. math::

  Δt_{\text{min}} = h

`c=dx/dt` with constant `c` and minimum time `h`,
makes the minimum space quantum to

.. math::

  x_{\text{min}} = ch

Energy compares two times and its minimum is thus `E=h/h=1` in the lowest level.
`mc² = hν = 1` produces `m=1/c²`.
Setting the maximum coordinate speed to `c=1`
makes the minimum mass `m=1`.

.. math::

  E_{\text{min}} = 1
  m_{\text{min}} = 1


Number values:

.. code-block:: python

   import scipy.constants as sc
   c = sc.c # 299792458.0
   h = sc.h # 6.62607015e-34
   t = h
   x = ch = sc.c*sc.h # 1.9864458571489286e-25

It makes sense to set `h=1` and `c=1`:

Then the minimal values are

.. math::

   c = 1 \\
   h = 1 \\
   t = 1 \\
   x = ch = 1 \\
   E = m = 1

One can continue like that for other quantities,
like electrodynamic `\boldsymbol E` and `\boldsymbol B`.
